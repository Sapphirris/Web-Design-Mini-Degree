This is a scratchpad for scoping features, Journaling ideas, notes, and adjustments that I'd like to make.

The core plan for the project will be to do some of the base coursework from the ZenvaAcademy mini degree and then re-approach the coursework with my own project in mind.

Future project idea is a CSS/Javascript comic viewer

   - Continuous Scroll (vertical, and horizontal).
